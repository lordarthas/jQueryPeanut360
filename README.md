# jQueryPeanut360

360-degrees image animator/slider which doesn't get in your way.

## Key features

This is a small jQuery plugin for creating 360-degreems image sliders. It doesn't try to do more than it needs to, but it instead exposes the methods which allow you to do anything you want.

These are the key points behind this plugin:

 - It just analyzes your img tags and show/hides them when necessary
 - It doesn't modify the DOM
 - It doesn't care if you wrap one or more of your images in another tag (such as and <a> to view a zoom)
 - It doesn't force you to use any provided UI or button, you just use your own
 - It just needs jQuery to work

## TODO

 - Handle mobile swipe events to turn slides
